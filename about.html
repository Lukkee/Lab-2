                <h2><ins>About me</ins></h2>
                <h4>Career</h4>
                <p>
                    I am currently studying Computer Engineering at Chalmers University of Technology, 
                    as well as working part-time as a guide at the National Science Center, Universeum.
                    I have recently gotten myself particularly interested in low-level programming, 
                    which is what my studies mainly revolve around, but I've read bonus courses in 
                    C-programming as well, to make sure I stay sharp in this area. My hobbies have long 
                    included different technical projects, from microprocessors to web-pages and databases, 
                    which is where I've learned most of my skills when it comes to different languages and 
                    models. But apart from technical projects I also have a great interest in marine biology, 
                    which I have both studied and worked with in the past.
                </p>
                <h4>Childhood</h4>
                <p>
                    I've always been a curious person, wanting to explore and learn, like when I was six and tried 
                    digging a hole to china in my backyard after some kids at school told me they did it,
                    only to hit a powerline and make the whole street's lights flash for a couple minutes as I went inside and
                    pretended I had been drawing the whole time. I think this curiosity drove me into Marine Biology, while my fathers
                    technical interests made me interested in learning about computers and eventually hopping on the engineering track.
                </p>
                <h4>Future</h4>
                <p>
                    My main goal for my future career is mixing both biology and computer engineering. Since I am greatly interested in both fields,
                    I want to have make a career in specialized lab-equipment for marine settings. And to do this I am planning on continuing my studies 
                    in Marine Biology after my engineering-degree, although this will most likely only be a part-time thing.
